A thief trying to escape from a jail. He has to cross N walls each with varying heights (every height is greater than 0). He climbs X feet every time. 
But, due to the slippery nature of those walls, every time he slips back by Y feet. 
Now the task is to calculate the total number of jumps required to cross all walls and escape from the jail.
Examples : 
 

Input : heights = [11, 11]
                maxHt = 10;
                slip = 1; 
Output : 4
He needs to make 2 jumps for first wall
and 2 jumps for second wall.
